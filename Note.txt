Do and Don't
	Do
		Always ask for clarification. Do not assume your asusmption is correct
		Understand the requirements of the problem
		There is nether the right answer nor the best answer. A solution designed to solve the problesm of a young startup is different from that of an established company with million of users. Make sure you understand the requirements.
		Let the interveiwer know what you are thinking. Communiate with your interviewer
		Suggest multiple approaches if possible
		Once you agree with your interviewer on the blueprint, go into details on each component. Design the most critical components first.
		Bounce ideas off  the inteviewer. A good interveiwer works with you as a teammate.
		Never give up
	Don't
		Don't be unprepared for typical interview question
		Don't jump into a solution without clarifying the reuirements and assumptions
		Don't go into too much detail on a single component in the begining. Give the high-level design first then drill down.
		If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask for the hints
		Again, communicate. Don't think in silence
		Don't think your interview is done once you give the design. You are not done until your interviewer says you are done. Ask for feedback early and often
