Consensus
  Means getting several nodes to agree on something
  can be formalized as: one or more nodes may propose values, and the consensus algorithm decides on one of those value
  a consensus algorithm must satisfy the following properties:
    Uniform agreement
      No two nodes decide differently
    Integrity
      No node decide twice
    Validity
      If a node decides value v, then v was proposed by some node
    Termination
      Every node that does not crash eventually decides some value
  The uniform agreement and integrity define the core idea of consensus.
  The validity make sure the data agree is valid
  Termination define the idea of fault tolerance - making sure there's always a node to decide some value

  Epoch numbering and quorum
    A concept to making sure the safety and liveness in leader election
    Take example Kraft in Kafka: we have 3 node A, B, C and A is leader
      Each node gonna have a epoch number which is used to define leader
      Scenario: A crashes,
        B gonna increase its epoc and start voting
        C see that vote and then accept B gonna be the new leader
        => C will increase its epoch to be the same as B
        Once A is alive, A will detect B is new leader and also increase A' epoch number to be the same as B
        What if B and C start to elect themselves as leader at same time?
        It's rare to have this case since Kraft implementation random time to start voting leader elect on eah node
        For example: node B can start a 150ms and node C can start at 250ms
        But if this happen
        System will detect it reaches the quorum so the leader election will be canceled
          This is to prevent the split brain problem
        And start the new election again

  Why service like Zookeeper is used?
    It contains set of features that turn our to be useful when building distributed systems:
      Linearizable atomic operations
        Such as compare-and-set operation
      Total ordering of operation
      Failure Detection
        If the session expires or disconnects, it is assumed the client has failed.
      Change notification
        Client can also watch them for changes and can findout when another client join the cluster or if another client fails
