Consensus
  Means getting several nodes to agree on something
  can be formalized as: one or more nodes may propose values, and the consensus algorithm decides on one of those value
  a consensus algorithm must satisfy the following properties:
    Uniform agreement
      No two nodes decide differently
    Integrity
      No node decide twice
    Validity
      If a node decides value v, then v was proposed by some node
    Termination
      Every node that does not crash eventually decides some value
  The uniform agreement and integrity define the core idea of consensus.
  The validity make sure the data agree is valid
  Termination define the idea of fault tolerance - making sure there's always a node to decide some value
