Data warehouse
  Used for Analytic
  There's 2 data model
    Star Schema (or cam be called multidimensional modeling)
      When table relationships are visualized, the fact table in the middle and surrounded by its dimension tables
        - Just like you have a click event on a product X belong to category A at date B on platform C
        Then you gonna use join to get related information based on those X,A,B,C ...
      Another variation of star schema is known as snowflake schema, where dimensions are further broken down into subdimensions
      Snowflake schema are more normalized than star schema but star schema is preferred since it's simpler to work with for analytics

Column-Oriented Storage
  Since for analytics, we mainly don't query all the column but the one we need
  So if we use row-based database, when we query data, it will load all the columns of data from disk into memory, parse them and filter out. This can take a long time
  The idea is simple: Don't store all values from one row together, but store all the values from each columns together instead
    If each column is stored in separate file, a query only needs to read and parse those column that are used in that query
  Sort Order
    Usually, we define the sort column when we create a table
      And the higher column, the more complicated compressions
