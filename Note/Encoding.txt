Binary Encoding
  MessagePack
    a binary encoding for JSON
  Protocol Buffer
    You define a schema and when you transfer the data over network, it will be encoded to binary
    In your schema, it will have data type, label and field tags
      such as: int32 name = 1;
    Usually, protobuf will encode the tag "1" and data type "int32", and the value of this field
    The label is mainly for generated code such as getter/setter function
  Thrift
    Similarly to protocol
  Avro
    More flexible, since it doesn't require you to init a "tag" for each field
