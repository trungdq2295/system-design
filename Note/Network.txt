Network
  The internet and most internal network in data centers (often Ethernet) are asynchronous packet network
  One node can send a message (package) to another node, but the network gives you no guarantees as to when it will arrive or whether it will arrive
  If you send a request, many thing can go wrong:
    Your request may have been lost (someone unplugged a network cable)
    Your request maybe waiting in queue and will be delivered later (perhaps the network or the recipient is overloaded)
    The remote node may have failed (it crashed or it slowed down)
    The remote node may have temporarily stopped responding. But it will start responding again later
    The remote node may have processed your request, but the response has been lost oon then network
    The remote node may have processed your request, but the response has been deployed and will be delivered later
  The sender can't even tell whether the packet was delivered: the only option is for the recipient to send a response message

  You do need to know how your software reacts to network problems and ensure that the system can recover from them
