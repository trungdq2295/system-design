System Design	
	Clarify
		Don't assume but to ask interviewer to clarify what they want
		Example: 
			Is this mobile app? or web app? or both
			What is the most important feature
		Do the back-of-the-envelope calculation
			Example: DAU, storage, network
Time Allocating
	Understand the problem and establish design scope: 3 - 10 minutes
	Propose high-level design and get buy-in: 10 - 15 minutes
	Design Deep dive: 10 - 25 minutes
	Wrap: 3- 5 minutes
Do and Don't
	Do
		Always ask for clarification. Do not assume your assumption is correct
		Understand the requirements of the problem
		There is nether the right answer nor the best answer. A solution designed to solve the problem of a young startup is different from that of an established company with million of users. Make sure you understand the requirements.
		Let the interviewer know what you are thinking. Communicate with your interviewer
		Suggest multiple approaches if possible
		Once you agree with your interviewer on the blueprint, go into details on each component. Design the most critical components first.
		Bounce ideas off  the interviewer. A good interviewer works with you as a teammate.
		Never give up
	Don't
		Don't be unprepared for typical interview question
		Don't jump into a solution without clarifying the requirements and assumptions
		Don't go into too much detail on a single component in the beginning. Give the high-level design first then drill down.
		If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask for the hints
		Again, communicate. Don't think in silence
		Don't think your interview is done once you give the design. You are not done until your interviewer says you are done. Ask for feedback early and often
