Reliability
  It means the system will continue to work correctly, even when things go wrong
  Thing can go wrong are called faults and system that anticipate faults and can cope with them are called fault-tolerant or resilient
  Fault is not the same as a failure
    Fault is usually defined as one component of the system deviating from its spec,
      An abnormal condition that may or may not lead to a failure
      Can be hardware-related or software-related ( bug in code)
    Failure is when the system as a whole stop providing required service to the user
      observable incorrect behavior
      Example: app crash when code is run

    You can't reduce the probability to a fault to zero. so it's good to design a fault-tolerance system that prevent faults from causing failutres
