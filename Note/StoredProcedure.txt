Stored Procedure
  Bad reputation:
    Code running in database is difficult to manage: compared to an application, it's hard to debug or to keep version control
    Database is often much more performance-sensitive than application server because a single database instance is often shared by many application
      A badly written stored procedure (e.g, using a lot of CPU/ memory time) in a database can cause much more trouble
  However in the modern database, you can just use programming language such as Java to create Store Procedures
  And data is kept in memory so the SP is quite fast since we don't need any I/O operation
