AD CLICK AGGREGATOR

1 billions click per day
2 millions unique ads

up to a few minutes from end-to-end
0.1kB per click (mostly for metadata analytics info)


100k Monthly Active User (MAU) for analysts
each views the analytics page 10 time per day on average


mesothelionma ads charge $1000 per click, so we don't really want to have any double charges occur
REvenuse is important


Functional Requirements
    - we should capture ad click events
    - we should be able to query the ad click events, as a marketing analyst


Non-functional Requirements
    - actual ad clicks and redirect should be pretty fast (low latency)
    - high availability for the ad click events

    - eventual consistency is good enough


Numbers
	How many click per second?
		1B click per day / 100k MAU
		-> 10,000 TPS
		(We'll say peak is 5x of average)

		Up to 50,000 TPS

	how much bandwidth for the clicks?

		10,000TPS * 0.1 kB per click
		= 1,000 kB per second
		= 1 MB per second

		50,000 TPS * 0.1 kB per click
		= 5 MB per second

	How much storage for 1 year of data?
		1 MB per second * 100k seconds in a day * 365
		= 100,000 MB * 365
		= 100GB * 365
		= 36500GB
		= 36,5 TB / per year

	How much storage for 10 years of data?
		36.5 TB * 10 = 365 TB


	100k MAU for analysts
	How many analytical page view per second?


	100k DAU
	10 times per day on average
	=> 100k  * 10 -> the number of page views per day
	 = 1 M pages view per day
