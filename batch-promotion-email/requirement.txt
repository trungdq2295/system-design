Batch Promotion Email


Requirement
	- Send 1M emails in 10 minutes, following a template with customizable info
	- Analytics on whether they click the stuff in emails
	- At most once delivery


Why 10 minutes?
	- For the convenience of the marketing users
	- For highlighting the impact of your marketing campaign. Why?
		- Sometime you don't want to send to all users at same time. This can cause a spike to your system
		- Or you want to view the interaction between user and email if the user click the email after receiving it during the day(from morning to night)


Scenarios:
	For highlighting the impact of your marketing campaign
	- Amazon.com that shows product recommendations ( this is expensive because each user can hve different product)

	For the convenience of the marketing users
	- A magazine telling you to subscribe ( this is just simple like hey, subscribe to our magazine)


Non-functional requriement
	- At most once delivery
	- the least amount of failed email sends as possible
	- High availability

Estimation number
1M emails to send in under 10 minutes
50kB per email ( let's assume without attachment


=> Email per second = 1M/ 10 * 60 = 10^6 / 500 = 10^4 / 5 = 2000 RPS


What's the bandwidth
2,000 email per second * 50kb = 100,000kb ~ 100Mb /second ~ 0.1 GB per second ~ 0.8gigabit per second
=> 1.0 gb per second is reasonable for one machine's bandwith on its internet connection


But what if we handle 2000 RPS on single machine?
2000 request per second
16 cores to CPU

2000/16 = 500/4 = 125 request per second for each core,
let say 100 request per core => 1000ms for 100 request per core
=> each request can only copy a core for 10ms (unrealistic)
=> each request should be aroudn 100ms => that's like 10 machine ( i think? )

if we have 64 cores => 30 request second per core ( too much core -> tooo expesnive)
